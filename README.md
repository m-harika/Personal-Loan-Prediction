# Personal Loan Prediction

Data Description:
The file Bank.xls contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer
demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with
the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the
last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers,
only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the
earlier campaign.

Domain:
Banking

Context:
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore
ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while
retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability
customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has
encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better
target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.
